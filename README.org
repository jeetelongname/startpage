#+title: A simple start page

This is a simple webscript that acts as a start page. it makes use of ruby
and sinatra to dynamically render things, idk. Ill add more features as I see
fit.

this is based on the concept of a web script, or basically a one file web app
that does not need all of the hulabaloo of a full project.

* Running
- Install ruby
- ~ruby index.rb -p PORT~ where ~PORT~ is the port number
- use a systemd service to start it on login or something.
